# FE in IRandFX

The codes here are homework exercises from the City UoL course "Financial Engineering in Interest Rates and FX (C++ Applications in Quantitative Finance). The homework will be grouped into the corresponding lectures as much as possible and ideally, every homework exercise will have its own main.cpp file along with the associated headers and source files to run the exercise, even if multiple files are used for the same exercise.
